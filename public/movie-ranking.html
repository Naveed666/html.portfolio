<h1>The Best Movies According to Naveed</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Man of Steel</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie because the actor represents
    superman in a very inique way, and it is just a powerful movie.
</p>

<h3>The age of Tron</h3>
<p>
    It is a sci-fi movie that uses a lot of CGI, and the very interesting 
    part about it is that the whole movie is based of a game I think.

<h3>The American Physco</h3>
<p>
    I love this movie because of the Sigma in there.
